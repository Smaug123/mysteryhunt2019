# mysteryhunt2019

During the MIT Mystery Hunt 2019, I produced a bunch of tools and solutions to various of the puzzles.
Most of them are scattered across dozens of environments (the Mystery Hunt is about 50hrs of solid puzzling), but a couple of them were just about solid enough to publish here.

You should expect these tools to be completely useless to you.
They were built to solve extremely specific problems under immense time pressure, where the only important thing was to get enough done to extract an answer to a puzzle.
